# Event-Sauced - PostgreSQL Engine

Welcome to the PostgreSQL engine for [Event-Sauced](https://github.com/YannickMeeus/event-sauced-ts).
As this is a component library, I would recommend readers to go check out the main library for
and overview of what Event Sauced is meant to be.

## Motivation

I like learning about databases, what they can - and more importantly - what they can not do.
This lead me to try and implement an opinionated, but quite thin - event sourcing framework
on top of the world's more popular databases.

And one of those seems to be PostgreSQL, so let's get started!

## Build status - CircleCI

![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/build/github/YannickMeeus/event-sauced-ts-postgresql.svg?style=for-the-badge)
I'm currently orchestrating everything using [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/YannickMeeus/event-sauced-ts-postgresql),
with a plan to move to GitHub actions when it either comes out of public beta or I enter (üôè) into the public beta.
